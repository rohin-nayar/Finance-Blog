### Federal Reserve Actions:
The Federal Reserve decided to maintain its current policy stance in June. While the median staff projection anticipates a single rate cut in 2024 (down from three expected earlier), Fed Chair Powell hinted that up to two cuts could still occur by year-end, contingent on economic conditions rather than as firm projections. A potential rate adjustment in September hinges on further inflation moderation, otherwise, a cut may be postponed until late December.

### Market Expectations and Indicators:
Investor sentiment, reflected in treasury yields, suggests expectations of future Fed rate cuts, particularly if long-term yields dip below short-term rates. Recent labor market data indicates stability with a marginal rise in the unemployment rate to 4% in May from 3.4% a year ago. Nonfarm payroll employment saw a healthy increase of 272,000 jobs in May. Inflation moderated to 2.6% in May, providing the Fed leeway to monitor economic health before making any rate adjustments.

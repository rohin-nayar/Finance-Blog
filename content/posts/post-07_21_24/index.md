### Major Market Movements: Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities, and Currencies

This past week witnessed significant turbulence across various asset classes, with equities, fixed income, commodities, and currencies all experiencing notable shifts. Here's a summary of the key events that influenced the markets.

### Political Developments

**Donald Trump Assassination**
The assassination of former President Donald Trump sent shockwaves through the political landscape, creating immediate uncertainty and volatility in the markets. This unprecedented event has raised numerous questions about political stability and its impact on economic policies.

**Biden Withdraws from Presidential Campaign**
In another dramatic turn, President Joe Biden has ended his election campaign amidst calls to withdraw his candidacy. Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the new Democratic nominee for the upcoming presidential election. This shift has significant implications for market sentiment, particularly concerning future economic and regulatory policies.

### Market-Specific Events

**Semiconductor Stocks Plunge**
Comments from Donald Trump on potential new restrictions on semiconductor exports to China have caused a significant drop in semiconductor stocks. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped a staggering 6.8% in a single day. Major players like Nvidia and ASML saw substantial declines, contributing to a 2.8% drop in the Nasdaq Compositeâ€”the largest drop in 19 months.

**US Policy on Taiwan**
Trump's remarks suggesting that Taiwan should pay for its own defense and indicating that the US might not protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion have added to geopolitical tensions. This uncertainty has weighed heavily on tech stocks and contributed to increased market volatility.

### Market Volatility

**VIX Index Spike**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a measure of expected future volatility, spiked this week, reflecting the market's heightened state of anxiety. The combination of political instability, economic policy uncertainty, and geopolitical risks has driven this surge.

### Currency Movements

**Sterling Recovery**
In the currency markets, the British pound (Sterling) has shown resilience, recovering to $1.30 against the US dollar (USD/GBP). This recovery comes amidst broader market turbulence and suggests some underlying strength in the UK economy or relative weakness in the USD.

### Global IT Outage

**Global IT Outage**
A significant global IT outage shocked the world this week, disrupting various industries and causing a ripple effect across markets. The extent and cause of the outage remain under investigation, but its impact on market operations and business continuity was profound.
